Standardized benchmarks have driven robot manipulation learning, but they overwhelmingly
assume a fixed, ground-supported base. Aerial manipulation breaks that assumption: the
arm moves the base it is mounted on, thrust is limited, and aerodynamics couple the two.
AM-Bench is an [Isaac Lab](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-lab) suite for studying how
embodiment, control, disturbances, and policy choice interact in that regime.

## Key Features

- **Embodiments spanning actuation regimes** — underactuated (`UAQuad`, `UAHexa`), fully
  actuated (`FAHexa`), and overactuated (`OmniHexa`), plus an `EE` floating end-effector
  oracle for isolating task logic from flight dynamics.
- **12 tasks across three interaction classes** — instantaneous contact, object transport,
  and articulated or constrained contact.
- **Standard low-level controllers** — 4-DoF and 6-DoF PID, L1 adaptive, and whole-body
  MPC, with Pyroki inverse kinematics.
- **Configurable disturbances** — aerodynamic drag, ground effect, near-wall effect, and
  rotor actuator saturation, all switchable per environment.
- **Policy-learning baselines** — ACT, Diffusion Policy, and OpenPI (π₀ / π₀.₅), sharing
  one canonical LeRobot dataset format, plus scripted experts for every task.
- **One action interface** — absolute end-effector pose, or absolute base pose and arm
  joints when a policy should command the whole body directly.

## Installation

A native Linux host (Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04), a discrete NVIDIA GPU, and Isaac Sim 5.1 with
Python 3.11 are required. WSL and Docker are not maintained paths.

Once Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab are installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ambench/ambench.git
cd ambench
source ../IsaacLab/env_isaaclab/bin/activate
./scripts/setup/install.sh
export JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu
export ACADOS_SOURCE_DIR="$(pwd)/ext/acados"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$ACADOS_SOURCE_DIR/lib:$ACADOS_SOURCE_DIR/build:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
python scripts/environments/list_envs.py
```

The standard installer initializes Pyroki and acados, builds the acados libraries,
installs their Python interfaces, and installs the two AM-Bench packages from
`source/`. Add the three exports to `~/.bashrc`, using the absolute path to your
AM-Bench checkout for `ACADOS_SOURCE_DIR`, so new terminals use the maintained
JAX and acados configuration.

See [Installation](https://ambench.github.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) for the
full procedure, then [Verify Installation](https://ambench.github.io/docs/getting-started/first-run/).

## Quick Start

Step an environment with zero actions to confirm the scene loads:

```bash
python scripts/environments/zero_agent.py \
  --task PressButton-Am-EE-Abs-PID-Direct-v0 \
  --num_envs 1 --headless --device cuda:0
```

Record demonstrations from the scripted expert:

```bash
python scripts/data/record_demos_scripted.py \
  --task PressButton-Am-FAHexa-Abs-PID-Direct-v0 \
  --dataset_root <dataset-root> \
  --state_keys ee_pos ee_quat gripper_width \
  --task_prompt "press the button" \
  --num_demos 10
```

## Documentation

[ambench.github.io/docs](https://ambench.github.io/docs/) covers installation, the
environment registry, configuration, demonstration collection, policy evaluation, and
extension guides. The source lives in the [ambench.github.io](https://github.com/ambench/ambench.github.io) repository under `docs/`; send documentation changes there.

Contributing: start from [Extend an Existing Environment](https://ambench.github.io/docs/extend/)
for the task, robot, controller, and policy guides, and
[Development Setup](https://ambench.github.io/docs/extend/development/) for editor
configuration, formatting, building the docs, and simulator performance tuning.
`AGENTS.md` and `CODING_STYLE.md` describe the repository conventions.
